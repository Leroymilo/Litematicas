# 2w_ABtileable_redcoder

A redcoder module except the outputs are every other blocks instead of every block (the standard design).  
Must be tiled up to 15 times to get the 15 possible outputs from a redstone signal.

# hidden_staircase

A 2 blocks wide staircase hidden flush in the floor. The input was put at the bottom but it can be moved easily.

# Smelter_V2

A simple super-smelter, this design makes sure to spread the fuel and stuff to smelt evenly between the furnaces.  
It is also small enough to fit in a chunk to avoid breaking it by loading and unloading it.
